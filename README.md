# Efficient Partial Sum Algorithms for Sequences

This repository contains research on efficient algorithms for calculating partial sums of various sequences. The goal of this project is to explore and implement algorithms for calculating the sum of subsequences in a variety of sequences, comparing them in terms of time and space complexity. Additionally, mathematical reconstructions will be attempted to identify formulas with lower computational complexity.

## Project Structure

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different sequence, and it contains the following:

- **C Program Implementation**: The algorithm for calculating the partial sum of the sequence in C.
- **Comparisons**: Benchmarking results comparing the performance of the implemented algorithm with other well-known algorithms for the same sequence.
- **Mathematical Analysis**: A section dedicated to the mathematical exploration of the sequence and the potential for simplification or optimization of the algorithm.
  
## Sequences Covered

This repository currently includes research on the following sequences:

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**  

... and many more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/efficient-sequence-sum.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the folder of the sequence you are interested in:
    ```bash
    cd [sequence-name]
    ```

3. Compile and run the C program:
    ```bash
    gcc sum_algorithm.c -o sum_algorithm
    ./sum_algorithm
    ```

4. Check the **README.md** in each sequence folder for specific instructions, benchmarks, and the mathematical analysis.
